            <h3>Nelson Wu</h3>
            <p>I am an online student majoring in Computer Science. I actually graduated
                with a Biology degree, but decided to switch careers during the COVID pandemic.
                Moved from Virginia to California about 2 years ago. Currently, working full-time
                and hoping to graduate this semester. I'm so done with school after this...I want my life back ðŸ˜­

            <h3>Madelyn Baker</h3>
            <p>I am a junior in Computer Science aiming to graduate in Spring 2026. During high school,
                I developed an interest in coding which led to me deciding to major in Computer Science
                in college. I have been living in Colorado for around nine years now and greatly enjoy it
                here. My hobbies include reading, video games, watching movies, and creative writing. </p>

            <p>I am a senior in Computer Science and hope to be graduating this fall. I started college in Neuroscience
                then moved to Biochem, and finally ended up in Computer Science. I've lived in Colorado for a majority
                of my life and started to learn how to ski about two years ago. In my free time I really enjoy hanging
                out with my friends reading, puzzles, and shopping.</p>
