## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve --host  [your assigned lab computer].cs.colostate.edu --port [your assigned port #]
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://[lab computer name].cs.colostate.edu:[your port #]/`. Or just read the http url that the terminal spits out at you when you run the ng serve command from above.
